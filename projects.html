						<h1>Nomad</h1>
						<p><strong>IOS Mobile Application ~ Swift using XCODE</strong></p>
						<p>Product Description: There are so many people of all ages who love to go on road trips, but documenting such trips is not so easy. The goal of this app is to pin pictures at locations with a description in order to have a visual scrapbook at the end of the trip. Even though there currently are some travel blogging and GPS tracking applications that can help track your trips, there is no single application that provides a cohesive overview. We can address this problem by organizing the different locations, media, and comments in a chronological list view for each trip with an additional mapview with pinpoints at each entry.</p>
						<p>Personal Contribution: This project was done for my Software Engineering class at Purdue. I was part of a 4 person team, and each of us had our own role to play in the project: 2 of us worked on back-end and 2 on front-end. My role focused on the back-end development of the application; more specifically with respect to the storing and loading of the inputed data, however as all of us made it a point to be aware of and understand each other's parts as well, I also know how the User Interface and User Experience has been set up. This app is available on the app store.</p>

						<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
						<p><strong>Android Mobile Application ~ Java using Android Studio & IntelliJ</strong></p>
						<p>Product Description: Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game that is best enjoyed by people of all ages who offen spend a large amout of time commuting without internet or anyother conectivity. Even though there are pleanty of tic-tac-toe games available, often times they all include complication and irritations like advertisements. This app is a very simple version of Tic-tac-toe, with no adverts or any other complcations.</p>
						<p>Personal Contribution: This project was my first android project, it is simple and designed to help me navigate my way around making android apps. </p>

						<h1>IRC Chat Server</h1>
						<p><strong>Linux GUI ~ C/C++ and GTK using VIM</strong></p>
						<p>Product Description: This is a simple server program designed to allow multiple users to communicate between themselves. This project was done in two parts: the first was the IRCServer which stores and organizes the client data. This data includes usernames and passwords of the users as well as the chat rooms and the messages exchanged in the rooms. To store this data it would have been ideal to use an external database such as SQL however, the aim of the project was to learn the various data-structures; accordingly I have used 2 different types of custome linkedlists. The 2nd part is the IRCClient which creates a user-friendly UI using GTK for the clients to use.</p>
						<p>Personal Contribution: This was my first program in C. </p>

						<h1>SafeWalk </h1>
						<p><strong>Android Application ~ Java using Android Studio & IntelliJ</strong></p>
						<p>Product Description: Safe Walk is a campus safety system (currently done manually) that allows people on campus to request that someone walk with them from one location to another on campus, this is especially useful for new students. The aim of this project is to replicate the Safewalk framework, accordingly it is done in 2 parts: server and client. The first part of this project handles requests sent from the user, organizes requests in terms of time and place, sends the corresponding requests to volunteers, and handles messages outlining successful and unsuccessful communications. Part 2 focuses on a socket client program running as a GUI on any Android machine, and this client conforms to the SafeWalk Client-Server protocol set up in the first part.</p>
						<p>Personal Contribution: This project was done to further my understanding of the Server/Client Architecture as well as to encourage colaborative programming. Since only 2 of us worked on this project we didn't split the work but rather worked together taking turns to type. Pair Programming was fantastic!</p>
